The project combined K-Means clustering to group similar transactions, HDBSCAN to detect anomalies, and Graph Network Analysis to track fund movement and hidden financial networks. A risk-scoring system aggregated these results, assigning fraud likelihood scores to transactions. The model processed large-scale financial data, applying feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection to improve accuracy. The final system provided explainability for flagged transactions, enhancing transparency in financial compliance.",
