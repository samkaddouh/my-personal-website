      description:
        "Developed a Flask-based web application that analyzes real-time Twitter data using NLP and Machine Learning for sentiment analysis. The system retrieves tweets via the Twitter API, cleans text through tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, and converts it into features using TF-IDF. Sentiment classification is performed using Logistic Regression and Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes, optimized through hyperparameter tuning and evaluated with confusion matrices. The application includes data visualizations (word clouds, polarity histograms) and a ranking system for trending topics. Processed data is stored in PostgreSQL, with pickle serialization and sparse matrices optimizing model inference.",
